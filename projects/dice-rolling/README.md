### Dice Rolling Simulator
By using the random module, Python can do things like pseudo-random number generation.
- Allow the user to input the amount of sides on a dice and how many times it should be rolled.
- Your program should simulate dice rolls and keep track of how many times each number comes up (this does not have to be displayed).
- Finally, print out how many times each number came up.
- Subgoals:
  - Adjust your program so that if the user does not type in a number when they need to, the program will keep prompting them to type in a real number until they do so.
  - Put the program into a loop so that the user can continue to simulate dice rolls without having to restart the entire program.
  - In addition to printing out how many times each side appeared, also print out the percentage it appeared. If you can, round the percentage to 4 digits total OR two decimal places.
- Bonus:
  - You are about to play a board game, but you realize you don't have any dice. Fortunately you have this program.
  - 1. Create a program that opens a new window and draws 2 six-sided dice
  - 2. Allow the user to quit, or roll again
  - Allow the user to select the number of dice to be drawn on screen(1-4) 2. Add up the total of the dice and display it
