Beginner Projects
=================
A list of projects for beginners.

If you're completely new to programming, you may want to look into a [tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python). Before starting, you should already know the basics of programming such as variables, loops, dictionaries, and how to define functions, as well as how to run programs on your own machine.

Each project idea has a basic goal for you to achieve, as well as subgoals that require a bit more thought, but help make your program more interesting. The overall intent for this repository is to serve as a learning resource for everyone and to help transition learners from a beginning level to an intermediate level. In addition, learners are encouraged to contribute their solutions to this repository and thereby learn the basics of Git.

Almost all projects can be completed in any language, but some were specifically written to be completed with Python.

Remember, if you don't know how to do something, Google is your friend.

If you are completely stuck:
```
$ python
>>> import antigravity
```

## Credits
I did not create any of these projects. I originally found them on [reddit](https://reddit.com/r/beginnerprojects) where they are maintained [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TyqD2_oDtiQIh_Y55J5RfeA91JJECc97xYIKM112H9I/edit?usp=sharing), although I have since added new ones.
